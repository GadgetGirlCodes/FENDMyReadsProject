Thank you to the [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001/parts/f4471fff-fffb-4281-8c09-2478625c9597) team for their great lessons on ReactJS!

A huge thanks goes to [Maeva NAP on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6L2jLHV9j8) for her outstanding walkthrough and the help and guidance it provided when I was utterly confounded.

Additional thanks to Ryan Waite and his extremely helpful [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bU1oWlLwY&feature=youtu.be).

And last, but most certainly not least, thank you to the Udacity reviewers. I don't know their names or who they are, but they provided me with fantastic insight to help finish my project to the best of my ability.
